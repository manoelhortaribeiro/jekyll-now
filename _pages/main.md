I'm a PhD student at EPFL, in Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, working at [dlab][dlab] with professor [Robert West][bob]. 
I'm also a member of [iDramaðŸŽ­][idrama].
My current research broadly focuses on the dynamics of content creation and consumption in Online Social Networks and fringe communities.
I received a B.S. and a M.S. in Computer Science from the [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais][dcc].
