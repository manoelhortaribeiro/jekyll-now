**My paper: "Message Distortion in Information Cascades" with Robert West and Kristina Gligoric was accepted as a full paper at #TheWebConf2019 **


I'm a  MSc student in Computer Science at [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais][dcc], Brazil. 
My current research interests lay in the intersection of machine learning and Online Social Networks (OSNs). 
I'm particularly interested in the dynamics and the detection of undesirable behaviour, such as *hate speech* and *fake news* in OSNs. 


During my undergraduate studies, I explored a wide variety of topics under the supervision of [Wagner Meira][meira], with projects such as:
-  [characterizing the video-game livestreaming community on Twitch.tv][1]; 
- [improving probabilistic graphical models for gesture and activity recognition][2];
- [prototyping a tool for exploring the trajectories of patients with cervical cancer][3]. 

The latter was the outcome of two internships I did at [Simula][simula] in Oslo, supervised by [Sagar Sen][sagar] and [Mari Nygard][mari]. 
On the industry side I have interned as a software developer at [Microsoft Research Center for SNUI][snui], 
in Melbourne (where I was an exchange student at [University of Melbourne][unimelb]), and worked on [SweetZpot][sweetzpot], 
a norwegian-based IoT startup that produces sports sensors.
