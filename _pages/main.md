I'm a  MSc student in Computer Science at [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais][dcc]. 
My current research interests lays in the intersection of machine learning and Online Social Networks. 
I'm particularly interested in the dynamics and the detection of undesirable behaviour, such as *hate speech* and *fake news* in OSNs. 
Last summer I did an awesome internship at EPFL with [Robert West][bob], [it was pretty awesome][dlab] and we published a WWW (TheWebConf?) [paper][www] out of our work.


During my undergraduate studies, I explored a wide variety of topics under the supervision of [Wagner Meira][meira], with projects such as:
[characterizing the video-game livestreaming community on Twitch.tv][1]; 
[improving probabilistic graphical models for gesture and activity recognition][2];
[prototyping a tool for exploring the trajectories of patients with cervical cancer][3]. 
On the industry side I have interned as a software developer at [Microsoft Research Center for SNUI][snui], 
in Melbourne (where I was an exchange student at [University of Melbourne][unimelb]), and worked on [SweetZpot][sweetzpot], 
a norwegian-based IoT startup.
